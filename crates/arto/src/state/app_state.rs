/// # Copy Semantics
///
/// This struct implements `Copy` because all fields are `Signal<T>`, which are cheap to copy
/// (they contain only Arc pointers internally). This allows passing `AppState` to closures
/// and async blocks without explicit `.clone()` calls, making the code cleaner.
///
/// **This aligns with Dioxus design philosophy**: `Signal<T>` is intentionally `Copy` to enable
/// ergonomic state passing in reactive UIs. Wrapping `Signal` fields in a `Copy` struct is the
/// recommended pattern in Dioxus applications.
///
/// # Why Per-field Signals?
///
/// We use per-field `Signal<T>` instead of `Signal<AppState>` for fine-grained reactivity:
/// - Changing `current_theme` doesn't trigger re-renders in components that only watch `document`
/// - Different components can update different fields concurrently without conflicts
/// - Components subscribe only to the fields they need (e.g., Header watches theme, Content watches the document)
///
/// If we used `Signal<AppState>`, any field change would trigger re-renders in ALL components
/// that access the state, causing unnecessary performance overhead.
